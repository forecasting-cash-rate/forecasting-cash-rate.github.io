Therefore, it includes both the HOLD and RAISE decisions. Given that the monthly inflation for August increased to 5.2 per cent for the first time since April, both options are on the table. The outcome will be indicative of the new governor's stance.\n>\n> In the longer perspective, my forecasts, especially those for weekly data, indicate possible decreases in the interest rates starting next year. These forecasts are available at: https://donotdespair.github.io/cash-rate-survey-forecasts/\n\n\n**By how much do you think the RBA will change the cash rate in the next meeting?**\n\n> 0 pbs\n\n**At what level do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> 4.1%\n\n**When do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> June 2023\n\n## RBA's decision\n\nTBA on 3 October 2023.\n\n## Forecasting system\n\nMy forecasting system for September is based on the cash rate target and government bond yields at various maturities as presented in the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023_09_files/figure-html/data plot yields-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe system consists of a 192 of models. Half of them are are models of weekly and the other half of monthly data.\n\nVector Error Correction models for weekly and monthly series with different model specification parameters. Univariate models for the cash rate capture complex patterns of data persistence using autoregressive moving average equation extended by time-varying volatility equation - a GARCH model. Part of the models include the leverage effect and/or time-varying risk premium. \n\nThe forecasts are pooled in two stages. Firstly, the models are weighted in four sub-groups VECM vs. ARMA and weekly vs. monthly data models proportionally to their cash rate forecasting ability. Such four pooled forecasts are equally weighted in the second stage to provide monthly forecasts reported above.\n",
