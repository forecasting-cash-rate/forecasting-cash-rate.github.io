The level of 4.35% is likely to stay unchanged by the second quarter of next year. This seems in line with Michele Bullock's communication, although the domestic sources of inflation talk could indicate otherwise. My forecasts are available at: forecasting-cash-rate.github.io\n\n**By how much do you think the RBA will change the cash rate in the next meeting?**\n\n> 0 pbs\n\n**At what level do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> 4.35%\n\n**When do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> November 2023\n\n## Forecasting system\n\nMy forecasting system for November is based on the cash rate target and government bond yields at various maturities as presented in the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023_11_files/figure-html/data plot yields-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe system consists of over two hundred of models. Half of them are are models of weekly and the other half of monthly data.\n\nThe novelty starting from this month is forecasting using a foreign sector represented by monthly trade weighted indices and interest rates of Australia's closest trading partners.\n\nVector Error Correction models for weekly and monthly series with different model specification parameters. Univariate models for the cash rate capture complex patterns of data persistence using autoregressive moving average equation extended by time-varying volatility equation - a GARCH model. Part of the models include the leverage effect and/or time-varying risk premium.\n\nThe forecasts are pooled in two stages. Firstly, the models are weighted in four sub-groups VECM vs. ARMA and weekly vs. monthly data models proportionally to their cash rate forecasting ability. Such four pooled forecasts are equally weighted in the second stage to provide monthly forecasts reported above.\n",
