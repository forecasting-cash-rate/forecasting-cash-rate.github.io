My forecasts hardly contain the current cash rate value within the forecast interval, with most of the forecast density mass indicating downward movements. My reading of these results is that the RBA will HOLD the cash rate at the current value to push the inflation down more. I expect the first interest rate cuts by mid-2024. My forecasts are available at https://forecasting-cash-rate.github.io/\n\n**Do you think the cash rate has peaked?**\n\n> YES\n\n**When do you think the RBA will first cut the cash rate?**\n\n> June 2024\n\n\n## Forecasting system\n\nMy forecasting system for November is based on the cash rate target and government bond yields at various maturities as presented in the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023_12_files/figure-html/data plot yields-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe system consists of over two hundred of models. Half of them are are models of weekly and the other half of monthly data.\n\nVector Error Correction models for weekly and monthly series with different model specification parameters. Univariate models for the cash rate capture complex patterns of data persistence using autoregressive moving average equation extended by time-varying volatility equation - a GARCH model. Part of the models include the leverage effect and/or time-varying risk premium.\n\nThe forecasts are pooled in two stages. Firstly, the models are weighted in four sub-groups VECM vs. ARMA and weekly vs. monthly data models proportionally to their cash rate forecasting ability. Such four pooled forecasts are equally weighted in the second stage to provide monthly forecasts reported above.\n",
