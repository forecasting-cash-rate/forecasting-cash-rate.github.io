Why do you think this?

> The combined forecasts from 36 bond-yield curve models using monthly
> and weekly data indicate that the cash rate is bound to increase
> steadily until around June next year and reach 4%, with a likely range
> from 3.2 to 4.8%. It will stay at this level by the end of 2023. The
> models predict an upward trend for the next several months, which
> translates to a likely rise in December that would allow for avoiding
> a sharper movement in February. The forecasts are available at
