The new data leads to forecasts indicating a decisive increase in the cash rate in August and likely increases further on.\n\n## Cash rate forecasts\n\nThe figure below presents the monthly cash rate series starting from January 2010, with the forecasts reported from August 2023 to July 2024 as the forecast mean and the 68% forecasting intervals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023_08_files/figure-html/forecast plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe table below makes the numerical values presented in the figure more accessible.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Monthly and quarterly cash rate forecasts\n\n|         | monthly| lower| upper|\n|:--------|-------:|-----:|-----:|\n|Sep 2023 |    4.14|  4.07|  4.22|\n|Oct 2023 |    4.20|  4.07|  4.34|\n|Nov 2023 |    4.19|  4.01|  4.42|\n|Dec 2023 |    4.17|  3.91|  4.44|\n|Jan 2024 |    4.12|  3.81|  4.46|\n|Feb 2024 |    4.12|  3.76|  4.52|\n|Mar 2024 |    4.13|  3.72|  4.59|\n|Apr 2024 |    4.13|  3.68|  4.66|\n|May 2024 |    4.14|  3.63|  4.72|\n|Jun 2024 |    4.16|  3.61|  4.79|\n|Jul 2024 |    4.16|  3.55|  4.83|\n|Aug 2024 |    4.17|  3.52|  4.90|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Survey answers\n\nBased on the forecasts above, and the analysis of forecasts from individual models, I formed the following survey answers:\n\n**When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?**\n\n|          | Sep 2023 | Oct 2023 | Nov 2023 | Dec 2023 | Feb 2024 | Mar 2023 | Apr 2024 | May 2024 | Jun 2024 or later |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Increase |         |         |         |          |          |          |          |          |                   |\n| Decrease |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |                   |\n\n**Why do you think this?**\n\n> Even though the 68% interval of my pooled forecast coming from a system of a hundred various predictive models does not include zero change, this is the case for over half of the models. Additionally, the 90% forecast interval includes the HOLD decision. This fact, combined with the decreasing monthly inflation at 4.9% in August, makes me interpret the forecasts indicating no change in the cash rate for at least another three months.\n\n**By how much do you think the RBA will change the cash rate in the next meeting?**\n\n> 0 pbs\n\n**At what level do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> 4.1%\n\n**When do you think the cash rate will peak?**\n\n> June 2023\n\n## RBA's decision\n\nHOLD.\n\n## Forecasting system\n\nMy forecasting system for August is based on the cash rate target and government bond yields at various maturities as presented in the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023_08_files/figure-html/data plot yields-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe system consists of a hundred of models. Half of them are are models of weekly and the other half of monthly data.\n\nVector Error Correction models for weekly and monthly series with different model specification parameters. Univariate models for the cash rate capture complex patterns of data persistence using autoregressive moving average equation extended by time-varying volatility equation - a GARCH model. Part of the models include the leverage effect and/or time-varying risk premium. \n\nThe forecasts are pooled in two stages. Firstly, the models are weighted in four sub-groups VECM vs. ARMA and weekly vs. monthly data models proportionally to their cash rate forecasting ability. Such four pooled forecasts are equally weighted in the second stage to provide monthly forecasts reported above.\n",
