When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in May 2023 June 2023


Why do you think this?

> The new reading of the CPI inflation reaching 7% in the first quarter of 2023 aligns the quarterly forecasts with the monthly indicating the cash rate at 3.77% within the next 3-5 months. The prediction bands around this value reach from 3.4 to 4.1 %. My interpretation is a likely raise by 15 pp this or next month. Beyond this horizon, the forecasts diverge with the bond yield curve modelling indicating further increases and the system focusing on inflation, labour market and expectations showing cuts. The arrival of new macro data occurs essential in such dynamically changing circumstances.
