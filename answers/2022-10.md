When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in Oct 2022 Nov 2022 Dec 2022 Feb 2023 Mar 2023 Apr 2023 May 2023

What do you expect the cash rate to be by the end of 2023?

> 4%

Why do you think this?

> The forecasts from the bond-yield curve models I estimated consistently indicate an increase in the value of the cash rate until mid-2023, after which levelling off should follow. By that time, the cash rate will nearly surely be higher than 3.6%, will most likely reach 4%, and is unlikely to exceed 4.4%. This would mean that the interest rates might get to the levels from early 2012.
