When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in Aug 2023 Sep 2023 Oct 2023


Why do you think this?

> My forecasts indicate a 15 basis point rise in the cash rate, with further increases up to 4.5% in October. The narrow forecast interval, spanning the values from 4.16 to 4.33% for August, leaves little doubt about the projected raises. However, the quarterly reading of year-to-year inflation at 6%, putting it on a speedy path towards the RBA's target, makes this raise somehow less likely this month.
