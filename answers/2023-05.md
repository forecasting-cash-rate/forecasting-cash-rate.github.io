When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in June 2023 July 2023


Why do you think this?

> Based on the new data from May, all my forecast systems are aligned and indicate a 15 basis point rise in the cash rate, with further increases expected throughout the year. The forecast intervals have also been narrowed to 3.9 to 4.1%, leaving little doubt about the projected raises. All this seems to be in line with the slowly falling inflation rate, which reached 6.8% in April. My forecasting system for this month includes thirty-two bond yield models for weekly and monthly data and sixty-four complex dynamics time-varying risk models encompassing the leverage effect and risk premium. The forecasts from individual models are further pooled based on their cash rate forecasting capacity.
