> In October 2022, portal [finder.com.au](https://www.finder.com.au/rba-cash-rate) invited me to join the panel of economists for their monthly RBA cash rate survey. My answers will be based on the forecasting analyses that I research and teach in my everyday work at the University of Melbourne. In the spirit of transparency, reproducibility, and sharing expertise, I am publishing my forecasts, and the survey answers on this website. I will keep expanding the data and models I use to produce the combined forecasts every month. Please, use the contact details if you want to share your insights, feedback, or suggestions with me.

## The most up-to-date forecasts

Have a look at the forecasts generated in [February 2025](2025_02.qmd)

## My cash rate forecasts

The hydra plot below presents monthly cash rate series starting from January 2015 together with my forecasts from the subsequent months.

```{r forecasts plot}
#| echo: false

# dates for the plot
id1         = "2015-01" # the beginning of data plot
id2         = "2025-02" # forecast origin
id3         = "2026-03" # the last forecast
time_id     = seq(from = zoo::as.yearmon(id1), to = zoo::as.yearmon(id3), by = 1/12)

# download series
icr_dwnld   = readrba::read_rba(series_id = "FIRMMCRTD")   # Cash Rate Target
icr_tmp     = xts::xts(icr_dwnld$value, icr_dwnld$date)
icr         = xts::to.monthly(icr_tmp, OHLC = FALSE)
icr         = icr[paste0(id1,"/",id2)]

# upload forecasts
files       = list.files("forecasts-backup/")
files       = files[!grepl("quarter", files)]
fc          = colorRampPalette(c("darkorchid1", "darkorchid4"))
cols        = fc(length(files))

plot(
  x = time_id, 
  y = c(as.vector(icr), rep(NA,13)), 
  main = "A hydra plot of cash rate and my forecasts",
  ylab = "[%]", 
  xlab = "time", 
  ylim = c(0,5),
  lwd = 3, 
  col = "darkorchid4",
  bty = "n", 
  type = "l"
)
for (fi in 1:length(files)) {
  header = TRUE
  if (fi > 16) header = FALSE
  forecasts_tmp = read.csv(paste0("forecasts-backup/",files[fi]), header = header)[,1:2]
  if (fi != 20) {
    lines( 
      x = seq(from = zoo::as.yearmon(forecasts_tmp[1,1]) - 1/12, to = zoo::as.yearmon(tail(forecasts_tmp[,1], 1)), by = 1/12),
      y = c(as.numeric(icr[zoo::as.yearmon(forecasts_tmp[1,1]) - 1/12]), forecasts_tmp[,2]),
      col = cols[which(grepl(files[fi], files))]
    )
  } else {
    lines( 
      x = seq(from = zoo::as.yearmon(forecasts_tmp[1,1]) - 1/12, to = zoo::as.yearmon(tail(forecasts_tmp[,1], 1)), by = 1/12),
      y = c(as.numeric(icr[zoo::as.yearmon(forecasts_tmp[1,1]) - 2/12]), forecasts_tmp[,2]),
      col = cols[which(grepl(files[fi], files))]
    )
  }
}

```

## My answers

The tables below juxtaposes my answers to the survey question regarding the following month's cash rate change with RBA's decision.

### 2025

| Survey taken in:   | Feb   | Mar | Apr | Jun | Aug | Sep | Nov | Dec |
|--------------------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Predicted decision | CUT   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Predicted change   | -0.10 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| RBA's decision     | 0.00  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

### 2024

Starting in 2024 the **Predicted change** is reported as the difference between the value of cash rate and the mean pooled forecast. This value might not be exactly consistent with the reported **Predicted decision** as the latter is the interpretation of the former.
