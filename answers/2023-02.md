When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in Mar 2023 Apr 2023 May 2023 June 2023


Why do you think this?

> My predictive systems for monthly and quarterly data unequivocally indicate further increases in the value of the cash rate by around 18 basis points in March. Moreover, the cash rate will likely increase to about 3.7 or 3.9% by June 2023. However, after that period, the forecasts give contradictory conclusions. Therefore, the arrival of new data will play a decisive role in shaping expectations for the year's second half.
