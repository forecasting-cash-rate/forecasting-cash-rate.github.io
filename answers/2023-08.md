When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Hold in Sep 2023 Oct 2023 Nov 2023


Why do you think this?

> Even though the 68% interval of my pooled forecast coming from a system of a hundred various predictive models does not include zero change, this is the case for over half of the models. Additionally, the 90% forecast interval includes the HOLD decision. This fact, combined with the decreasing monthly inflation at 4.9% in August, makes me interpret the forecasts indicating no change in the cash rate for at least another three months.
