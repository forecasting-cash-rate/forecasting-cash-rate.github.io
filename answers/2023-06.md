When you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Increases in July 2023 Aug 2023


Why do you think this?

> Despite the lower reading of monthly inflation in June at 5.3%, my forecasts tell the same story as last month. They indicate a 15 basis point rise in the cash rate, with further increases expected throughout the year. The narrow forecast interval, spanning the values from 4.16 to 4.34%, leaves little doubt about the projected raises.
