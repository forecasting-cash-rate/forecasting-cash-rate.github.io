When do you think the RBA will change the cash rate?

Hold in Oct 2023 Nov 2023


Why do you think this?

> The 68% forecasting interval from my predictive system containing nearly two hundred models of weekly and monthly data spans the cash rate values from 4.09 to 4.25 per cent. Therefore, it includes both the HOLD and RAISE decisions. Given that the monthly inflation for August increased to 5.2 per cent for the first time since April, both options are on the table. The outcome will be indicative of the new governor's stance.

> In the longer perspective, my forecasts, especially those for weekly data, indicate possible decreases in the interest rates starting next year. These forecasts are available at: https://donotdespair.github.io/cash-rate-survey-forecasts/
