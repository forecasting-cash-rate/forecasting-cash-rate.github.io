Its results indicate that in all of the systems except for one all of the yields are driven by the same stochastic trend determining the memory properties of the data. However, in the eight-variable monthly system three such stochastic trends are found which is in line with the bond-yield curve level, slope, and curvature factors. Capturing these data features using Vector Error Correction models is proven to substantially improve the forecasting precision."

    "text": "A disclaimer\nThe surveyed panel of economists at finder.com.au is heavily gender biased with only 15 percent of the panellists being women. This is a problem because non-representative expert panels are not objective and quite likely pushing the interest of a specific demographic group. Therefore, before accepting the invitation I urged the portal to invite more female economists to the panel and was ready to put down the invitation depending on the answer. Saranga who is organising the survey explained to me that they are inviting as many women as men and shared with me the list of folks that were invited with me. I concluded that the under-representation of women in the panel is not an effect of finder’s malpractices, but rather reflects the problem of economics as a field. We all share the responsibility to make the field representing the society more accurately by shifting the cultural and organisational practices. I accepted the invitation and do my best for the change to happen."

The forecasts follow a slight upwards trend in cash rate value up to June 2023, reaching the value of 3.4% for the monthly forecast and 3.7% for the quarterly one. After that period, the quarterly forecast goes down, and the monthly flattens. Both met at a value of around 3.5% by the end of 2023.\nThe data updates from late 2022 and early 2023 led to a noticeable revision of forecasts compared to my November forecasts. As a result, both the peak and the end-of-the-year forecasted values of the cash rate are now at lower levels.

The novelty is two new models for quarterly data downloaded from RBA’s website using an R package readrba. The variables in this new system include the cash rate and CPI inflation, 1-year-ahead inflation expectations based on surveys of professional economists and union leaders, 10-year bond yields, unemployment and employment rates. Therefore, models based on such variables account for the general economic conditions and labour markets. Importantly, they take into consideration inflation and its expectations. The quarterly data spanning the period starting in the second quarter of 2002 and finishing in the last one of 2022 is plotted below.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this data set, two forecasting models were developed using the R package vars: one including all the variables as reported in the plot above, and the other without inflation expectations allowing the series to start in 1995. These limits are dictated by data availability. The two systems of variables were put in Vector Error Correction models with one cointegrating relationship. The resulting forecasts up to one year ahead were pooled and reported above.\nThe monthly forecasts were based on the same forecasting system as the one I developed for November forecasts. The updated data is plotted below."

Univariate models for the cash rate capture complex patterns of data persistence using autoregressive moving average equation extended by time-varying volatility equation - a GARCH model. Part of the models include the leverage effect and/or time-varying risk premium.\nThe forecasts are pooled in two stages. Firstly, the models are weighted in four sub-groups VECM vs. ARMA and weekly vs. monthly data models proportionally to their cash rate forecasting ability. Such four pooled forecasts are equally weighted in the second stage to provide monthly forecasts reported above."
